#ARDC Supported GNU-radio SETI curriculum Workshop files

Following materails presents a complete syllabus for a course in radio SETI, focusing on teaching astronomy, radio communication, and digital signal processing. For different weeks of the module, we have created three types of materials: (1) lecture notes to guide the instructor through three daysâ€™ worth of lectures, (2) pre-lab reading that instructors can distribute to their students, (3) lab worksheets for use during the lab, and (4) pre-designed GNU Radio Companion (.grc) files that instructors can either load directly or use to guide students in creating their own.
